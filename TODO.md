(right now as of 12/21/11 it just posts a status to your feed, that's all it does)

== some feature ideas

* Instead of just posting a status, look for a relevant video and suggest it. Give the user the ability to choose one the suggested video / audio assets, or none.  Use youtube, bandcamp and other APIs to perform this search.

* In addition to overtly shared songs (status update) add the ability to notify in the feed (not a status update) a continuous stream, from a radio station for example.

* Integrate with radio playlist websites like [Spinitron](http://www.spinitron.com). Probably need to scrape them.

* Integrate with shoutcast metadata.

* Add an about page explaining what the point of this is.

* Show what friends are listening to

* deal with access token timeout
