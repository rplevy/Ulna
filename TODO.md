(right now as of 12/21/11 it just posts a status to your feed, that's all it does)

== some feature ideas

* Instead of just posting a status, look for a relevant video and suggest it. Give the user the ability to choose one the suggested video / audio assets, or none.
* Integrate with radio playlist websites like [Spinitron](http://www.spinitron.com).
* Add an about page explaining what the point of this is.
* Show what friends are listening to
